title: "Control Flow"
teaching: 10
exercises: 10
questions:
- "How do I repeat operations?"
- "How do I make decisions?"
- "How do I call built-in functions?"
objectives:
- "Write scripts that use `for` loops to iterate over lists and character strings."
- "Write scripts that use `if`/`elif`/`else` to perform conditional operations."
- "Call built-in functions."
- "Call methods on strings and lists."
- "Use online help to inspect functions' documentation."
- "Use `range` and `for` to iterate over a sequence of numbers."
keypoints:
- "Repeat things with `for` loops."
- "Use `if`/`elif`/`else` to make choices."
- "Use built-in functions like `len` and `max` to do calculations."
- "Objects like strings and lists have methods that operate on them."
- "Use `range` to generate a list of numbers."
