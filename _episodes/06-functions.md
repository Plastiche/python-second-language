title: "Writing Functions"
teaching: 10
exercises: 10
questions:
- "How can I make code more readable?"
- "How can I make code reusable?"
objectives:
- "Write a function taking a fixed number of parameters and having a single point of return."
- "Write functions whose parameters have default values."
- "Write functions with multiple points of return."
- "Write functions that return multiple values."
- "Extract functions from longer programs."
- "Trace the execution of nested non-recursive function calls."
- "Correctly identify the scope of variables."
keypoints:
- "Use `def` to define a new function."
- "Give parameters default values to make use easier and intent clearer."
- "Use `*args` to handle variable-length parameter lists."
- "Use `return` at any point to return values."
- "Turn repeated or deeply-nested pieces of code into functions."
- "Functions temporarily store values on a call stack."
